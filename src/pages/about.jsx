      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>Hi there! My name is Yreish Pozo and I am a software engineer based in Los Angeles, California.</p>
      
      <p>I fell in love with coding in high school, where I was first introduced to computer science. I loved the challenge of solving complex problems with code and the satisfaction of seeing my projects come to life.</p>
      
      <p>After completing my degree in Computer Science from the University of California, Los Angeles, I started my career as a software engineer at a startup. I worked on a variety of projects, from building a mobile app to developing a machine learning algorithm for data analysis.</p>
      
      <p>In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies and building side projects. One of my recent projects was a web app that helps users track their daily water intake and reminds them to drink more water throughout the day.</p>
      
      <p>Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about me. If you have any questions or would like to connect, please feel free to reach out!</p>
